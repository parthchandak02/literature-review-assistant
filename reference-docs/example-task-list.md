Search Strategy

To conduct a systematic review titled “Advancing Telemedicine Through UX: A Systematic Review of Adaptive Interface Design for Diverse Patient Populations,” a comprehensive and structured search strategy was designed to identify relevant studies published until December 2022\. The search focused on retrieving literature addressing telemedicine, user experience (UX) design, adaptive interfaces, and diverse patient populations across various healthcare settings.

Databases and Search Terms

The following databases were searched to ensure comprehensive coverage: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and Google Scholar. The search strategy employed a combination of Boolean operators, truncations, and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms. The primary search terms included:  
	•	Telemedicine: (“telemedicine” OR “remote healthcare” OR “digital health”)  
	•	UX Design: (“user experience” OR “UX” OR “interface design” OR “user-centered design”)  
	•	Adaptivity: (“adaptive interface” OR “personalized design” OR “responsive systems”)  
	•	Diversity: (“diverse populations” OR “health disparities” OR “equity” OR “accessibility”).

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Studies were included if they:  
	1\.	Explored telemedicine systems with a focus on UX or interface design.  
	2\.	Addressed the needs of diverse patient populations, including demographic or health disparities.  
	3\.	Provided insights into adaptive or personalized interface technologies.  
	4\.	Were published in English and peer-reviewed journals.

Studies were excluded if they:  
	1\.	Focused solely on technical or non-user aspects of telemedicine.  
	2\.	Lacked a focus on diverse patient populations or adaptivity in design.  
	3\.	Were editorial pieces, opinion articles, or conference abstracts.

Screening and Data Extraction

All retrieved articles were screened in two stages: (1) title and abstract screening and (2) full-text review. References from included studies were also reviewed to identify additional relevant papers. Data extraction focused on study objectives, methodologies, telemedicine applications, UX strategies, adaptivity frameworks, and outcomes for diverse patient populations.

This rigorous strategy ensured a comprehensive and unbiased synthesis of the literature, addressing critical gaps identified in prior reviews.

Research Question for Identified Gap

“How can adaptive interface design in telemedicine enhance user experience and accessibility for diverse patient populations, particularly those with varying levels of digital literacy, cultural backgrounds, and healthcare needs?”

Justification for the Research Question

The identified gap revolves around the limited exploration of adaptive interface designs that cater to the unique needs of diverse patient populations. Existing studies often focus on general usability or technical implementation of telemedicine platforms, overlooking the nuanced challenges faced by populations with diverse demographic characteristics, including cultural diversity, varying levels of digital literacy, and health disparities. This research question aims to address these overlooked aspects by examining how UX principles and personalization techniques can be strategically implemented to improve inclusivity and equity in telemedicine delivery. This focus aligns with the need for a more patient-centered approach to telemedicine interface design that accommodates diverse end-user needs.
