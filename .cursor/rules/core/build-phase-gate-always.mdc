# Build Phase Discipline

## Current Build Order
Phase 1: Foundation -> Phase 2: Search -> Phase 3: Screening -> Phase 4: Extraction & Quality -> Phase 5: Synthesis -> Phase 6: Writing -> Phase 7: PRISMA & Viz -> Phase 8: Export & Orchestration

## Rules
- Build in exact phase order. Do not implement Phase N+1 code before Phase N is approved.
- After completing a phase, run acceptance criteria tests before proceeding.
- Each build phase has specific test files listed in the v2 spec Part 8.
- When in doubt about which phase we're in, ask the user.

## Verification After Each Phase
```bash
uv run pytest tests/unit -q
uv run pytest tests/integration -q
uv run python -m src.main --help
```

## Strict Commit Safety
- Before any commit, inspect staged files and abort if secrets or runtime artifacts are staged.
- Forbidden by default: `.env`, `logs/**`, `data/outputs/**`, and other run-specific generated artifacts.
- Only proceed if the user explicitly asks to override this block.
