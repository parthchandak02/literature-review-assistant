# End Every Response With "What Next?"

At the end of EVERY response -- no matter how short or long -- add a final section titled:

`---`
`What next?`

This section must contain 2-4 concrete, specific options the user could ask for next, formatted as a short numbered list. Options should be derived from the actual context of the current conversation and project state, not generic filler.

## Rules for the "What next?" section

- Place it AFTER all substantive content, separated by a horizontal rule (`---`).
- Options must be specific to what was just discussed or done. Never write vague options like "continue development" or "ask me anything."
- Each option should be phraseable as a direct user command (e.g., "Run the app and review results", "Fix the RoB quality gate", "Update config/review.yaml topic").
- Include at least one option that advances the project toward its core goal: IEEE-submission-ready systematic review manuscript.
- Include at least one option that tests or validates the last change made.
- If the user just asked a conceptual question, one option should be the obvious next implementation step.
- Keep the whole section under 6 lines.

## Example (correct)

```
---
What next?
1. Run the app with the current review.yaml and check the Activity tab output
2. Tweak the screening thresholds in config/settings.yaml and re-run
3. Export the manuscript draft to LaTeX and validate IEEE compliance
```

## Example (wrong -- too vague)

```
---
What next?
1. Continue with development
2. Ask me if you have questions
3. Test things out
```

Never skip this section. Even for one-line answers.
