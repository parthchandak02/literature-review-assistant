# Systematic Review Methodology

## Seven Core Steps (must execute in order)
1. Define research question (PICO/PICo/PICOT)
2. Develop and register protocol (PROSPERO format)
3. Conduct search (>=3 databases + grey literature, full Boolean strings documented)
4. Screen studies (dual independent review, two-stage: title/abstract -> full-text)
5. Assess quality (domain-based RoB tools, NEVER summary quality scores)
6. Extract and synthesize (dual extraction, meta-analysis when feasible)
7. Present findings (GRADE SoF table, PRISMA diagram, structured manuscript)

## Risk of Bias Tool Routing
- RCTs -> RoB 2 (5 domains: randomization, deviations, missing data, measurement, selection)
- Non-randomized -> ROBINS-I (7 domains, different judgment scale: Low/Moderate/Serious/Critical/No Info)
- Qualitative -> CASP
- NEVER use summary quality scores -- always domain-based assessment

## Meta-Analysis Thresholds
- I^2 < 40%: fixed-effect model
- I^2 >= 40%: random-effects (DerSimonian-Laird)
- Funnel plot: only when >= 10 studies
- Statistics computed by scipy/statsmodels ONLY, never by LLM

## GRADE: 8 Factors
- 5 downgrade: risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, publication bias
- 3 upgrade: large effect, dose-response, residual confounding
- Starting: High for RCTs, Low for observational
