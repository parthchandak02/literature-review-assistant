I. INTRODUCTION
Fiscal Year (FY) 2018-19 was the fifth year of operation for the My Health LA (MHLA) program.
The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (DHS) developed the MHLA program in 2014 to
fill a gap in health care access in Los Angeles County. MHLA participants receive primary medical care at
contracted Community Partner (CP) clinics throughout Los Angeles County. They can also receive dental
services at select CP sites. When needed, participants also receive specialty, inpatient, emergency and
urgent care at Los Angeles County DHS facilities. To be eligible for MHLA, participants must be adults
living in Los Angeles County and be ineligible for publicly funded health care coverage programs such as
full-scope Medi-Cal. MHLA participants must also have a household income at or below 138% of the
Federal Poverty Level.
MHLA is closely aligned with the department’s mission is to “ensure access to high-quality, patient-
centered, cost-effective health care to Los Angeles County residents through direct services at DHS
facilities and through collaboration with community and university partners.”
The goals of the MHLA program are to:
Preserve Access to Care for Uninsured Patients.
• Ensure that Los Angeles County residents who are not eligible for public health care
coverage have a medical home and can access needed services.
Encourage coordinated, whole-person care.
• Encourage better health care coordination, continuity of care and patient management
within the primary care setting.
Payment Reform/Monthly Grant Funding.
• Encourage appropriate utilization and discourage unnecessary visits by providing monthly
grant funding as opposed to fee-for-service payment.
Improve Efficiency and Reduce Duplication
• Encourage collaboration among health clinics and providers and avoid unnecessary service
duplication by improving data collection, developing performance measurements and
tracking health outcomes.
This annual report, covering FY 2018-19, is designed to provide the public, policy makers, participants,
clinics, researchers and other interested groups with detailed information about the MHLA program. At
the end of FY 2018-19, 142,105 Los Angeles County residents were enrolled in the MHLA program. There
were also 49 Community Partner clinic agencies and 214 clinic sites contracted to provide care for
participants. MHLA participants had an average of 3.57 primary care visits during the year, and 70% of
the MHLA population had a primary care visit.
Payments to clinics for MHLA participants totaled $49.4 million for primary care services and nearly $7
million for dental services. MHLA also paid about $9.3 million for pharmacy services.
During FY 2018-19, MHLA instituted important programmatic and administrative changes. DHS amended
the MHLA contract in November 2018. As part of the amendment, MHLA created new audit tools and
3

instituted access standards for how quickly participants must be able to receive care. The program also
added new covered services, including medication therapy management by pharmacist, annual wellness
visits and alcohol and/or substance abuse screening and brief intervention.
Other contract changes took effect at the beginning of FY 2019-20, including an increase in the Monthly
Grant Funding (MGF) rate from $28.56 to $32 per month and a new requirement that enrolled
participants must be seen at least once in the prior 24 months as a condition of MGF payment to the
clinics. Participants can stay enrolled in the program even without such a visit, but clinics will not get
paid for those participants.
MHLA had a successful Fiscal Year 2018-19 serving its participants and we are thankful for everyone’s
contributions to the program.

II. 2018-19 PROGRAM ACTIVITIES
A. ENROLLMENT AND COMMUNICATIONS
This section of the report discusses outreach, application and enrollment trends in the MHLA program.
Key 2018-19 highlights were:
• MHLA ended its fifth programmatic year with 142,105 uninsured Los Angeles County
residents enrolled in the program.
• MHLA ended the year with 68,014 individuals disenrolled from the program.
• 46% of participants disenrolled from MHLA for failure to renew never had a visit.
Communications and Outreach
The MHLA program utilizes its website (dhs.lacounty.gov/mhla) to convey information to MHLA CP
clinics, current and potential enrollees and the general public. The website is a comprehensive
repository of information and contains all of the programmatic and contractual documents required by
CPs to participate in the MHLA program. This includes patient and CP newsletters, fact sheets, reports
and detailed pharmacy information such as up-to-date formularies. The website also displays
instructions and guidance related to One-a-App, the online program used to screen and enroll
participants.
The MHLA program also produces and posts on the website Provider Information Notices and Provider
Bulletins, which describe contractual and operational changes to the program. The public facing section
of the website is translated into Spanish.
During FY 2018-19, the MHLA website had a total of 140,562 visits for an average of 11,713 visits per
month. The average number of monthly website visits increased from 2,999 visits in FY 2017-18, and
3,032 in FY 2016-17.
MHLA produces a variety of information sheets in eight languages - Armenian, Chinese, English, Korean,
Spanish, Tagalog, Thai and Vietnamese. The two most commonly used information sheets explain the
basics of the MHLA program and describe how and where to enroll. All information sheets are available
on the website for download free of charge. MHLA has several other information sheets available on the
website including information on MHLA pharmacy services and how MHLA participants can access
behavioral health services.
The MHLA program continues to disseminate program information and updates to CPs through the
monthly newsletter, “CP Connection.” MHLA also sends out “My Healthy News” in English and Spanish
to participants with important information as needed. These two publications are intended to keep CPs
and MHLA program participants up to date with program information. In FY 2018-19, MHLA also
produced posters and distributed them to all of the clinic sites.

MHLA Eligibility Review Unit (ERU)
The MHLA Eligibility Review Unit (ERU) develops, implements and communicates the eligibility and
enrollment rules for MHLA. The unit also monitors how those rules are applied in the online One-e-App
enrollment and eligibility system.
Additionally, the ERU provides MHLA eligibility trainings for CP enrollers on the process for enrolling
patients in MHLA as well as how to refer individuals to other governmental medical assistance programs
for which they may be eligible. In FY 2018-19, the ERU conducted three eligibility trainings. The unit also
overhauled its trainings to cover both the program’s eligibility rules as well as how to enroll participants
through the One-e-App system.
To keep CPs informed, the ERU holds regular conference calls with “eligibility leads” from the clinics.
Eligibility leads are key CP staff members responsible for staying abreast of changes to MHLA eligibility
policies and processes and sharing this information with the enrollers at their clinic. The ERU helps CP
enrollers through the enrollment and re-enrollment process in real time through the Subject Matter
Expert telephone line. This help line assists enrollers who have questions about the specifics of a MHLA
application in progress, and enrollers frequently use the line to call the ERU with eligibility issues in real
time. In FY 2018-19, the line received 3,112 calls from CPs.
MHLA Applications and Enrollment
MHLA enrollment is conducted at the CP clinics through the One-e-App system. Certified Enrollment
Counselors (CECs), Certified Application Counselors (CACs) and/or Certified Application Assistors (CAAs)
screen potentially eligible individuals for the program during the enrollment process. Once eligibility has
been assessed, the CP staff enroll participants into the program.
An applicant is considered enrolled in MHLA when an application is completed and all required eligibility
documents are clearly uploaded (i.e., proof of identification, Los Angeles County residency and income).
One-e-App allows for real-time eligibility determination.
During FY 2018-19, MHLA saw a 49% increase of One-e-App users across the system. Altogether, 1,526
people had One-e-App access. That includes 421 enrollers taking applications, 885 clinic staff with “read
only” access, 69 system administrators, 59 supervisors and 92 other users.
MHLA’s annual enrollment target is 146,000 participants. At the end of this fiscal year, there were
142,105 participants enrolled in MHLA. The enrollment represented over 97% of the target (Table A1),
but enrollment declined each month beginning in August 2018. The exact reason for the decline is
unknown. However, it may be due to federal immigration policies that have created some fear and
uncertainty among immigrant communities. Some of the drop, particularly a little later in the fiscal year,
may have been because of changes in the contract that mean CPs only get paid if participants are both
enrolled and have had an allowable clinic visit in the prior 24 months. As a result of the change, some
clinics may not be enrolling participants who are unlikely to come in for primary care.
The program expects enrollment declines to continue in FY 2019-20 because the state has expanded
full-scope Medi-Cal to young adults ages 19-25 regardless of immigration status. About 3,000 young
adults in MHLA will become eligible for full-scope Medi-Cal on January 1, 2020.

Disenrollments and Denials
The MHLA program tracks participant disenrollments and denials. Disenrollments occur when there is a
change in a participant’s eligibility status resulting in the person no longer meeting the eligibility criteria
for the program. For example, participants who move out of Los Angeles County or obtain health
insurance are no longer eligible for the MHLA program. Participants may also decide to voluntarily
disenroll from the program or not to renew their coverage at their annual renewal date. Since
participation is completely voluntary, participants may choose to seek care at DHS clinics or other, non-
MHLA clinics. As a result, they no longer need to be in the program.
A denial occurs when a person is enrolled in MHLA but is subsequently retroactively denied by the ERU
going back to their initial date of application. This happens if the program learns during an eligibility
audit that a participant had full-scope Medi-Cal during the entire duration of their MHLA coverage or
that the documentation required to prove the participant’s eligibility in the MHLA was never submitted
by the enroller. Participants can also be denied if ERU determines that the CP processed the application
incorrectly and the participant was found to be ineligible.
7

Participants who have been denied or disenrolled from MHLA can re-apply at any time provided they
meet eligibility requirements. There is no cost or waiting period to re-apply. Enrollment in the program
fluctuates daily as new applicants enroll, existing participants renew eligibility and participants are
disenrolled or denied.
There were 181,902 participants enrolled in the program during FY 2018-19. During the year, 5,863
(3.2%) were denied (Table A2) and 68,014 participants (37%) were disenrolled (Table A3).
Table A2 identifies the primary reasons why participants were denied from the program. The majority of
denials were due to incomplete applications. This means that CP enrollers submitted applications that
were missing some or all of the core MHLA eligibility documents (i.e. proof of income, Los Angeles
County residency, and/or identity). This follows the same trend as prior fiscal years, when most denials
were also due to incomplete applications. The Eligibility Review Unit continues to work with clinic
enrollers to inform them about the importance of completing applications.
The MHLA program permits participants to submit affidavits when proof of income, identity, and
residency are not possible for the applicant to produce. If any of these are missing, however, the
person’s application will be denied.

Table A3 illustrates the reasons why MHLA participants were disenrolled from the program. The majority
of disenrollments were due to participants not completing the renewal process before their annual
renewal deadline, consistent with the trends from prior fiscal years.

Renewals
Participants are required to renew their MHLA coverage every year during an in-person interview at
their medical home clinic prior to the end of the participant’s one-year enrollment period. Enrollers
complete the renewal using the One-e-App system. The MHLA program notifies participants by postcard
90, 60 and 30 days prior to the end of their 12-month program coverage that their renewal date is
approaching. MHLA participants may renew their coverage up to 90 days prior to their renewal date.
Failure to complete the renewal process prior to the end of their 365-day coverage results in the
participant’s disenrollment from MHLA. Individuals who are disenrolled from the program have the
option to re-enroll at any time with no penalty or waiting period and at no cost.
Table A4 provides the current renewal and re-enrollment rates compared to the previous fiscal year. Of
the 139,995 MHLA participants due to renew last fiscal year, 72,553 (52%) participants renewed on
time. Of the 66,467 individuals that did not renew, 28,713 (21%) came back within the year to reenroll in
the program, meaning 72% of MHLA participants renewed or reenrolled in the program this fiscal year.
The re-enrollment rate for the program is the same as last fiscal year.

Graph A2 captures the time gap between disenrollment and the participant’s subsequent re-enrollment
in the program. 28,713 participants chose to re-enroll in MHLA after their disenrollment, a majority of
whom (14,204, or 49%) did so within the first 30 days of their disenrollment. 5,609 individuals (20%)
reenrolled between 31-60 days of being disenrolled, and 3,536 (12%) re-enrolled within 91-180 days.
These rates of re-enrollment are consistent with the previous fiscal year.

The MHLA program looked at the utilization trends of those MHLA participants who were disenrolled
from the program for failure to renew and who never re-enrolled into the program. Of the 66,467
participants who were disenrolled from MHLA for failure to renew and never returned to the MHLA
program (Table A4), 46% of them never had a visit with their MHLA CP clinic, indicating that many of
these participants may not have renewed because they were not using the program.

B. PARTICIPANT DEMOGRAPHICS
This section of the report examines the demographic makeup of the individuals enrolled in MHLA.
Latinos continued to comprise the largest group of enrollees, making up over 95% of program
participants. As for language, 91% participants indicated that Spanish was their primary spoken language
and 7% indicated that English was their primary spoken language. Most MHLA participants (46%) were
between 25 and 44 years old. In FY 2018-19, MHLA enrolled 837 homeless individuals - less than 1% of
enrolled participants. More participants were female (60%) than male (40%).
Key FY 2018-19 demographic highlights for the MHLA Program are:
• 95% of participants identified as Latino.
• 60% were female and 40% were male.
• Less than 1% identified as homeless.
• Service Planning Area 6 had the largest concentration of MHLA participants at 22%.

C. PROVIDER NETWORK
This section of the report describes the MHLA provider network.
Key FY 2018-19 highlights were:
• The number of MHLA medical homes, 214, remained similar to last year.
• 71% of MHLA medical homes were open to accept new participants throughout
the fiscal year.
• A total of 63 (29%) medical home clinic sites were closed to new patients at some
point during the fiscal year.
Clinic Sites and Capacity
MHLA ended FY 2018-19 with a total of 49 CP agencies and 214 primary care clinics.
The MHLA Contract Administration Unit surveys CPs twice a month to determine whether there are any
changes in clinic capacity and whether clinic panels should remain open or closed to new patients. The
MHLA database and website are updated immediately upon notification of a change of open/closed
status. A clinic is considered to have capacity if it can schedule an urgent primary care appointment
within 96 hours and a non-urgent primary care appointment within 21 days.
During FY 2018-19, 63 clinic sites closed to new patients at some point in the fiscal year due to limited
capacity to meet the access standards. The number of “closed” sites increased compared to the 51 clinic
sites that were closed at some point last fiscal year.
Medical Home Distribution and Changes
At the time of enrollment, MHLA participants select a primary care medical home. The medical home is
where they receive their primary and preventative care services. This includes prevention, diagnosis,
treatment of illness or injury, health advice, diagnostic services (basic labs and radiology), chronic
disease management, immunizations, referrals, health education, medicines and other services.
Participants retain their medical home for 12 months. They may receive care at any clinic site within a
clinic agency’s network but may not receive their primary care outside of the agency. DHS creates a
monthly report of the distribution of MHLA participants by medical home and posts the report on the
MHLA website.
Participants may change their medical home during the first 30 days of enrollment for any reason. They
also can change throughout the year for any of the following reasons: 1) if the participant has a new
place of residence or employment; 2) if the participant has a significant change in their clinical condition
that cannot be appropriately cared for in the current medical home; 3) if the participant has a
deterioration in the relationship with the health care provider/medical home that cannot be resolved; or
4) if there is a termination or permanent closure of a medical home. If the MHLA participant has some
other special circumstance that merits a medical home transfer, this may be approved by MHLA
management using the medical home transfer reason of “Administrative Request.”
13

There were 103 approved medical home changes this fiscal year, most commonly during the first 30
days of enrollment at the request of the participant.
DHS Participation in the MHLA Network
DHS provides a range of specialty, urgent care, diagnostic, emergency care and inpatient services to
MHLA participants—all at no cost to the participant. Participants, however, must comply with the Medi-
Cal screening and enrollment process when they go to DHS facilities. If they don’t, they may be
financially liable for the cost of care.
Hospital and specialty care services are critical components in the MHLA service continuum. MHLA
participants have access to hospital services at DHS facilities only; hospital services at non-DHS facilities
are not covered by MHLA. DHS hospitals available to MHLA participants are LAC+USC Medical Center,
Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Olive View-UCLA Medical Center and Rancho Los Amigos National
Rehabilitation Center. However, MHLA participants can and should seek services for emergencies at the
nearest hospital emergency department consistent with federal and state laws that govern access to
emergency care.
New Empanelment Referral Form (NERF) Patient Referrals
DHS works to connect as many uninsured patients as possible to primary care providers. When
uninsured patients present at DHS clinics or hospitals, DHS staff offer them the choice of a CP clinic or a
DHS clinic depending on where the patient resides. Patients are referred to clinics through the New
Empanelment Referral Form (NERF) process. The form is used when a DHS clinician wishes to begin the
process of connecting a DHS patient to a primary care medical home.
In recent years, DHS has built additional primary care capacity, which has led to a decrease in referrals
out to MHLA CPs. When a patient does indicate the desire to enroll in MHLA, several factors can create
challenges in the program’s efforts to facilitate a visit by the patient to a CP clinic for screening and
enrollment. Frequently, mailing addresses and contact phone numbers provided by patients change.
Additionally, some patients choose not to be referred if they feel that their medical issue was resolved
at DHS and they do not perceive a need for ongoing primary care services.
D. CONTRACT AND AUDIT ADMINISTRATION
This section of the report focuses on MHLA Contract and Audit Administration unit. This MHLA unit
ensures that CPs follow contractual guidelines as well as federal, state and county regulations in the
provision of clinical care to program participants. CPs are responsible for addressing identified
corrections/deficiencies.
In addition, the unit provides contract oversight for vendor services (e.g., printing, translation, and
interpreting services). As mandated, the Contract and Audit Administration unit conducts annual
comprehensive evaluations of CPs’ facility, administration and medical records while maintaining
oversight and compliance with regulatory agency requirements for all CP medical home clinics. The unit
assists in improving the quality and safety of clinical care and services provided to MHLA participants.
The reviews conducted by the Contract and Audit Administration unit include the following:
14

1. Facility Site Review (FSR)/Credentialing Review (CR)
2. Medical Record Review (MRR)
3. Dental Record Review (DRR)
The Contract and Audit Administration unit works with CPs to help them successfully comply with the
implementation of a Corrective Action Plan by providing technical assistance and conducting focused
reviews if the audit does not reach compliance thresholds.
As a result of the 2018 contract changes, the annual audit tools were revised. This year, the audit
process was streamlined to become more meaningful and less administratively burdensome to CPs. For
example, MHLA removed any element from the Facility Site Review (FSR)/Credentialing Review (CR) that
was already being audited by the managed care plans, the California Department of Health Care Services
or the federal Health Resources and Services Administration. In addition, the overall audit scores on the
MRR that triggered a Corrective Action Plan were lowered.
During FY 2018-19, the unit completed annual audits for all CP sites and vendors. The results are
detailed in this section of the report. Even if a Corrective Action Plan is not required, MHLA informs CPs
of the deficiencies and urges the CPs to address them to ensure the highest quality program and so
there aren’t repeat deficiencies the following year.
Facility Site Review (FSR)/Credentialing Review (CR)
FSR/CR includes the process of evaluating the facility for patient access and appropriate service
provision. Through the FSR/CR, MHLA also ensures that all required professional licenses and
certifications are current and issued from the appropriate licensing/certification agency.
There were 221 approved sites throughout FY 2018-19. FSR/CR were not conducted for 12 of the 221
sites because some sites were terminated, and others were brand new to the program. Of the 209
audits conducted, only two showed deficiencies. Each had one deficiency and only one was required to
submit a Corrective Action Plan.
The Contract and Audit Administration unit monitors timely access standards as part of the FSR. CPs
shall make available to MHLA participants appointments for included services within 21 calendar days
for non-urgent primary care health services or within 96 hours for urgent primary health care services.
Every clinic site met the timely access standards. For urgent primary care appointments, 61% of clinics
could provide same-day appointments and 28% could provide appointments within 24 hours. For non-
urgent primary care appointments, 32% of clinics could provide same-day appointments and 49% could
provide appointments within 1-5 business days.
Medical Record Review (MRR)
MRR includes the process of measuring, assessing and improving quality of medical record
documentation. The medical record review supports effective patient care, information confidentiality
and quality review processes that are performed in a timely manner. The MRR ensures documentation is
accurate, complete and compliant according to the standards of care.
15

Of the 205 MRRs that were conducted, 139 sites showed deficiencies and two were required to submit a
CAP. MRR were not conducted for 16 of the 221 sites because they were either brand new sites or they
were smaller clinic sites and didn’t see MHLA patients during the fiscal year.
The most frequent MRR deficiencies are listed in Table C1.
There are 11 DHS core elements that are subject to liquidated damages if the score on any of those
elements is below the satisfactory compliance of 90%. FY 2018-19 is the first year of this provision. If a
CP has five or more of the same repeat deficiencies during each of three consecutive fiscal years and
does not reduce its total number of repeat deficiencies between the first and third fiscal years,
liquidated damages may be assessed.
The DHS core elements are specialty referral, TB screening, lipid screening, mammogram, cervical cancer
screening, immunization, seasonal flu vaccine, colorectal cancer screening, abuse/neglect assessment,
diabetic retinal scan/ophthalmology referral and foot exam/podiatry referral.
Altogether, there were 1,084 deficiencies in the MRR during FY 2018-19. Of those, 905 were related to
the 11 DHS core elements (Table C2). 138 (67%) of the 205 sites showed one or more deficiencies for
any of those elements. In addition, 132 (64%) of the 205 sites scored below the minimum satisfactory
compliance (90%).

Dental Record Review (DRR)
DRR includes the process of assessing the quality of dental record documentation for accuracy and
performance. The DRR ensures documentation for dental services is compliant with recognized
standards of care. As necessary, the DRR includes a claims processing review to verify that billed services
concur with documentation within the dental record and meet the definition of a billable visit.
A total of 51 DRRs were conducted. Of those, 13 (25%) sites showed deficiencies. None of the 51 dental
sites were required to submit a CAP. The deficiencies are listed in Table C3.

E. PARTICIPANT EXPERIENCE
This section highlights program participants’ experience with the MHLA program and includes data
related to the MHLA call center and the filing of formal complaints.
Key FY 2018-19 highlights were:
• Member Services received a total of 18,009 calls in FY 2018-19 (for an average of
1,553 calls per month).
• There was a total of 14 formal participant complaints filed by participants, with the
top complaints being related to access to care and quality of service.
Customer Service Center Call Center
Member Services staff members are available to answer questions for MHLA participants Monday
through Friday from 7:30 a.m. – 5:30 p.m. at 844-744-MHLA (844-744-6452). Interpreters are available
for MHLA participants who speak a language not spoken by a call center agent. Member Services is
available to help participants with questions about the program as well as to process medical home
changes, complete disenrollments, process address and phone number changes and order replacement
identification (ID) cards.
During FY 2018-19, MHLA’s Member Services call center received an average of 1,553 call per month
18,009 calls total. The number of incoming calls decreased 32% from last year’s total of 26,438. The top
reasons for calls were general program questions, eligibility verification, ID card request and medical
home changes.
Participant Complaints
Member Services staff members also take calls from MHLA participants who are experiencing issues and
they try to help resolve those issues. When the problem requires more intensive research or involves a
clinical investigation, a participant’s complaint is escalated to the DHS Grievance and Appeals Unit
and/or the Quality Management-Clinical Compliance Unit (for clinical related complaints). In the MHLA
program, these are called formal complaints.
MHLA works closely with CPs to address participant concerns and complaints. The program believes that
direct communication with the CP is essential to improve participant experience and satisfaction.
Participants who file formal complaints are notified by letter within 60 days of the filing of the complaint
with the resolution of their issue.
Of the 18,009 calls that came into Member Services in FY 2018-19, 14 were “formal complaints.” This is
an increase from the 10 formal complaints in FY 2017-18 but a significant decrease from the 29
complaints filed in FY 2016-17. The top formal complaint reasons were related to delays in service and
treatment/diagnosis/inappropriate care. Table E1 identifies formal complaints by category as well as
the percentage of complaints by category over a three-year period.

F. SERVICE UTILIZATION
This section of the report provides an analysis of the clinical and service data from both CP and DHS
facilities in order to assess disease morbidity, health outcomes and utilization of services.
Key FY 2018-19 highlights were:
• 70% of MHLA participants had a primary care visit.
• MHLA participants had an average of 3.57 primary care visits per year.
• 36,186 unduplicated MHLA patients accessed 162,920 specialty care visits.
• 7% of all MHLA participants had an emergency department (ED) visit.
• 17% of visits to the ED were considered avoidable.
• The hospital readmission rate (30, 60, 90 days combined) was 18%.
During FY 2018-19, there were 181,902 participants enrolled in the MHLA program in the year. This
section of the report analyzes the health care service utilization patterns of these participants.
Summary of Clinical Utilization Data
In the MHLA program, primary and preventive care services are provided by CP medical homes while
specialty, urgent, emergency and inpatient care services are provided at DHS facilities. Tables F1 and F2
provide summary participant utilization information for FY 2018-19 at CPs and DHS facilities.
There was a slight increase in the percentage of MHLA participants who accessed at least one primary
care service this year (70%) compared to last year (68%).

Primary Care
During FY 2018-19, 70% of MHLA participants had at least one primary care visit at their medical home
clinic during their period of enrollment. This percentage of primary care service utilization was a slight
increase from prior years (68% in FY 2017-18 and 64% in FY 2016-17). The average number of visits for a
MHLA participant in FY 2018-19 was 3.57. This is a slight increase from last fiscal year, when MHLA
participants had 3.51 primary care visits per year on average. Appendix 1 provides detailed information
on the number of primary care visits for MHLA participants by medical home.1 Table F3 provides a
comparison of the average number of primary care visits from the inception of the program.

1 In the MHLA program, participants generally receive the majority of their primary care visits at their chosen medical home clinic
site, but they may obtain care at other clinic sites within the same agency. Encounter data is reported by the clinic that provided
the service to the participant (even if the visit was not at the participant’s chosen medical home). As a result, it is possible that a
participant had primary care encounter data submitted for them on behalf of a clinic site that was not their chosen medical home.
21

Of the 126,748 MHLA participants who had a primary care visit this fiscal year, individuals with chronic
conditions had a higher average number of visits per year (5.57) than those without chronic conditions
(2.29). 2 The average number of visits per year for participants with both chronic and non-chronic
conditions have not changed significantly through the life of the program (Table F4).

MHLA Pharmacy Program
MHLA contracts with Ventegra, a local Pharmacy Services Administrator, to provide over 800 retail
pharmacy options for MHLA participants to fill their prescriptions. This pharmacy network is in addition
to the dispensary or pharmacy option that some CPs have on-site. This network of retail pharmacies
increases the number of locations where MHLA participants can fill their medications and includes
pharmacy locations that may be closer to the participant’s home or work. In addition, utilizing the
Ventegra pharmacy network increases medication availability for some patients during evenings and
weekends. Participants also can have medications mailed to their home or clinic using the DHS Central
Fill Pharmacy (participants receive a telephone consultation by a DHS pharmacist).
Outside of DHS Central Fill, DHS pharmacies provide medications to MHLA participants only in those
instances when the prescription is written by a DHS physician (i.e. during an emergency, specialty or
urgent care visit at a DHS facility).
Table F6 shows the number and percentage of MHLA participants who filled a prescription through the
MHLA program over the last three fiscal years. The data indicate that 56% of MHLA participants filled at
least one medication in FY 2018-19, up from 52% last fiscal year. However, what appears to be an
increase in the total number of prescriptions filled in FY 2018-19 is not solely due to an increase in
utilization. The pharmacy network implementation was phased in over time. The increase in pharmacy
utilization is likely due to improvements in data collection once all prescriptions filled by MHLA
participants were being run through Ventegra and their claims adjudication database.
According to data received from Ventegra, 54% of medications dispensed in the MHLA program in FY
2018-19 were generic, 15% were purchased under the 340B program, 23% were over the counter (OTC)
medications, and 7% were diabetic supplies. Ventegra’s data also shows that 88% were filled at
contracted pharmacies, 10% were filled at on-site CP dispensaries, and 2% were mailed to patients via
the DHS Central Pharmacy.

Specialty Care Services
The following section provides analysis on specialty care utilization by MHLA participants at DHS clinics
and hospitals in FY 2018-19.
DHS’ eConsult is a web-based system that allows CPs and DHS specialists to securely share health
information, discuss patient care and determine if MHLA participants need an in-person visit with a
specialist. The total number of eConsults submitted from MHLA CPs in FY 2018-19 was 89,861. Of those,
63,736 were directed for face-to-face visit.
Table F8 reflects the total number of eConsults requested by CP clinicians or staff during the fiscal year
and the subsequent specialty care visits that followed. There were 36,186 unduplicated MHLA
participants who received a total of 162,920 specialty care visits at DHS in FY 2018-19. This fiscal year
saw an 8% increase in the total number of specialty care visits provided to MHLA patients (from 150,528
to 162,920). On average, a MHLA participant who saw a specialist had 4.5 specialty visits during the
year. About 20% of all MHLA participants saw a specialist, compared to 17% of participants last year.

Urgent Care Services
MHLA covers urgent care services for MHLA program participants at any of the DHS hospitals or
comprehensive health centers that have an urgent care clinic. Participants are instructed to go to DHS, if
27

possible, in the event the participant experiences an urgent care situation requiring care that is beyond
the scope of the CP’s capabilities.
Tables F11 and F12 illustrate urgent care utilization among MHLA participants. 3.48% of all MHLA
participants (6,332) utilized urgent care services at DHS for a total of 9,829 urgent care visits. The
utilization rate for urgent care was 68.14 per 1,000 participants per year.

Emergency Department (DHS)
MHLA participants can receive no-cost emergency services at LAC+USC Medical Center, Olive View
Medical Center and Harbor UCLA Medical Center. This section provides an analysis of emergency
department (ED) utilization by MHLA participants in FY 2018-19. It is important to note that actual ED
utilization among the MHLA population may be underreported as this data only includes ED utilization at
DHS hospitals. If a MHLA participant receives emergency services from a non-DHS hospital, that data is
not included here.
In FY 2018-19, 12,808 MHLA participants had 18,174 ED visits at DHS facilities. The rate of ED visits was
126 per 1,000 participants in FY 2018-19, compared to 101 per 1,000 participants last year (Table F13).

Table F14 illustrates the number of primary care visits that MHLA participants had in the same fiscal year
that they visited a DHS ED. This data does not distinguish whether the ED visit was before or after the
primary care visit at the CP clinic. Nearly 17% of MHLA participants who had an ED visit in FY 2018-19 did
not have a visit at their CP medical home that same year.

The data in Tables F15 and F16 illustrate the total number of MHLA participants who utilized an ED
service, further broken down by housing status (i.e., homeless or not homeless). 10,654 MHLA
participants (5.9% of the total MHLA enrolled) visited a DHS ED in FY 2018-19. Of these, 145 identify as
homeless. Nearly 93% of MHLA participants never had ED visit (homeless and not homeless combined),
and that for both homeless and non-homeless ED users, most visited the ED only one time (Table F16).

Avoidable Emergency Department Visits
ED visits that are not emergency related and could be considered avoidable3 are identified as avoidable
emergency department visits. Appendix 2 lists the avoidable ED visits by type, number of visits and
unique participants. Table F17 provides the rate of avoidable emergency department visits for each of
the years since the program’s inception. Nearly 17% of ED visits by MHLA participants in FY 2018-19
were considered avoidable. This rate is largely unchanged from last year’s rate. The top three avoidable
ED visit reasons were: headaches, dorsalgia (back pain), and acute upper respiratory infections.

DHS provides inpatient hospitalization for MHLA participants at four DHS hospitals. Similar to emergency
department utilization data, this inpatient utilization data only captures data from DHS facilities. If a
MHLA participant received inpatient services (as a result of an emergency admission) from a non-DHS
facility, that data is not included in this analysis.
Table F18 shows inpatient hospitalization admissions for all MHLA participants. 3,085 of 181,902 MHLA
program participants (1.7%) in FY 2018-19 were admitted to a DHS hospital. This rate is largely
unchanged from last fiscal year (1.5%).

G. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER (SUD) SERVICES
In July 2016, MHLA entered into a partnership with the Los Angeles County Department of Public
Health’s (DPH) Substance Abuse Prevention and Control Division (SAPC) to provide Substance Abuse
Disorder (SUD) treatment services for any MHLA participant who needs it.
33

With the addition of SUD services to the MHLA program, a full array of drug and alcohol treatment
services became available to MHLA participants at no cost. These services include withdrawal
management (detox), individual and group counseling, patient education and family therapy, recovery
support services, opioid treatment, recovery bridge housing, and case management.
MHLA participants can access SUD services in a number of ways. They can “self-refer” by calling DPH’s
Substance Abuse Service Helpline, find a provider nearby through SAPC website or receive a referral
from their MHLA CP medical home clinic.
This fiscal year, a total of 570 MHLA participants accessed SUD services. This was a significant increase
from last fiscal year, when only 323 patients accessed SUD treatment services. This is likely due in part
to an outreach campaign by the program with clinics, advocacy groups and patients regarding the
availability of these services. This year, the MHLA convened a workgroup with DPH, DMH, community
clinics and health advocacy groups to develop outreach materials and strategies to better message the
availability of behavioral health services through the MHLA program. MHLA also held two trainings for
community providers on Medication Assisted Treatment for opioid use disorder.
Graph G1 illustrates those MHLA participants who sought SUD treatment services from DPH, sorted by
age. The largest group of SUD treatment recipients was the age group, 26 to 34 years old.

Graph G2 provides a breakdown of MHLA participants by SUD issue. The 570 participants may have had
more than one SUD issue (total of 687 SUD issues) during the fiscal year. 381 patients sought SUD
treatment services for methamphetamine addiction, 227 individuals utilized treatment for alcoholism,
and 38 participants sought help for marijuana addiction. The remaining participants 40 sought SUD
treatment for cocaine, heroin or prescription drug use.

The utilization of SUD treatment is expected to increase in FY 2019-20 with new pilot projects aimed at
expanding access to MHLA participants. One will bring SUD treatment providers into select CP clinics to
provide services to MHLA participants, and another will enable SUD treatment providers to enroll
eligible participants into MHLA.

H. HEALTH CARE SERVICE EXPENDITURES
This final section of the annual report provides information on the payments made to CP clinics under
the MHLA program in FY 2017-18. For this purpose, DHS tracks the payments made to each CP for
primary care services utilizing Monthly Grant Funding (MGF).
Key FY 2018-19 highlights were:
• Total MGF payments to Community Partners for primary care related services
totaled $49,437,017.28.
• Payments for dental services totaled $6,953,821.92.
• The Monthly Grant Funding rate was $28.56.
MHLA Health Care Service Payment Categories
Health care service payments are made to CP clinics in two ways: (1) MGF payments for preventive and
primary care, and (2) Fee-For-Service payments for dental services provided by those CP clinics with
dental contracts with MHLA. In addition, MHLA pays for medications on behalf of participants. In FY
2018-19, MHLA paid $9.32 million for pharmacy-related services.
Community Partners – Primary Care
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors allocated $56 million for the provision of primary care for
CPs. Of this allocation, a total of $49.44 million in MGF payments were paid to the CPs in FY 2018-19.
Community Partners – Dental Care
Although dental care is not a benefit of the MHLA program, twenty-five (25) MHLA Community Partners
provided dental services to MHLA eligible or enrolled participants in FY 2018-19. A total of $6.95 million
in dental funding was spent by the CPs in FY 2018-19.
MHLA per Participant per Month Health Care Service Costs
There was a total of 1,730,998 MHLA participant months in FY 2018-19. The total MGF paid by MHLA to
CP clinics for primary care services was $49.44 million.
CPs receive an MGF payment per month of $28.56 for each person enrolled in their medical home clinic
in that month, irrespective of whether the participant used services that month. As noted in Table F5 of
the annual report, 55,154 (30%) of MHLA participants did not have a primary care visit in FY 2018-19
representing 416,630 enrollment months. A total of $11.90 million ($28.56 x 416,630 months) in
payments were made on behalf of participants who did not utilize a primary care service. The way
payments are made changed at the start of FY 2019-20, with CPs only receiving MGF for enrolled
participants who had a primary care visit in the prior 24 months.

III. CONCLUSION AND LOOKING FORWARD
FY 2018-19 was the fifth programmatic year for the MHLA program. As the report demonstrates, the
services available to the MHLA participants continue to expand under the program to provide a
comprehensive array of primary and supportive services to meet the needs of these patients.
Participants are receiving regular primary care, and when needed, specialty, emergency, urgent and
inpatient care. They also are obtaining medications through a robust network of community pharmacies
as well as through CPs and DHS.
This year, MHLA began implementation of the new contract amendment, putting into practice new
audit tools, enforcing access standards and adding new CPT codes. Program staff also built the systems
to implement the 24-month rule for MGF payment, which took effect July 1, 2019. At the end of FY
2019-20, we will be able to see the impact of that rule on both participant utilization and on the MHLA
budget.
In addition, MHLA program continues collaborating with Los Angeles County’s Department of Public
Health (DPH) Substance Abuse Prevention and Control (SAPC) unit to increase access to SUD services for
MHLA participants through pilot projects. Among those is a project that will bring SAPC providers into
the CPs to provide SUD treatment. We will continue to partner with SAPC and CP clinics to increase
participant’s knowledge of and participation in SUD treatment programs. We are also working on a
project with the L.A. County Department of Mental Health to use Mental Health Prevention Services Act
funding to provide prevention services at the CPs. The project is expected to begin in spring 2020.
The ongoing work to expand outreach and enrollment opportunities in collaboration with the
Community Partner (CP) clinics continued in FY 2018-19. This not only includes reaching those
individuals who are eligible for, but not yet enrolled in MHLA, but also includes the work to engage
participants who are due for their annual renewal. In FY 2019-20, we will be closely tracking enrollment
and trying to better understand the declines. We will also work on seamlessly transitioning the young
adults who become eligible for full-scope Medi-Cal.
During FY 2019-20, we will be partnering with the CPs to reduce MHLA participants’ avoidable
emergency room visits to DHS hospitals. In addition, we aim to decrease the number of patients who are
simultaneously empaneled to DHS clinics and enrolled in MHLA. Finally, we will continue encouraging
CPs to join LANES, the health information exchange in LA County. At the end of FY 2018-19, 15 CPs had
signed contracts with LANES and several were beginning to access data through the exchange. Being on
LANES enables CPs and DHS to securely share patient health information with the goal of more care
coordination.
DHS continues to work in partnership with the Community Clinic Association of Los Angeles County
(CCALAC), the Los Angeles health advocacy community and our Community Partner clinics to build and
grow a strong, comprehensive health care coverage program for eligible, uninsured residents of Los
Angeles County.

4 In the MHLA program, participants generally receive the majority of their primary care visits at their chosen medical home, but
they may obtain care at other clinics within the agency. Encounter data is reported by the clinic that provided the service to the
participant (even if the visit was not at the participant’s chosen medical home). As a result, it is possible that a participant had
primary care encounter data submitted for them on behalf of a CP clinic site that was not their medical home.
