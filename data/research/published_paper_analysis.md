- Two-column layout
- IEEE citation style
- Technical writing style
- Less emphasis on PRISMA (more common in health journals)

---

## Common Patterns Identified

### Abstract Patterns:
- **Health Journals (JMIR, PLOS, BMJ)**: Structured abstracts common
- **IEEE Journals**: Unstructured abstracts
- Word limits: 150-350 words typically

### Section Structure:
1. Abstract
2. Keywords
3. Introduction
4. Methods (with detailed search strategy)
5. Results (often with subsections)
6. Discussion
7. Conclusion (sometimes)
8. References
9. Acknowledgments
10. Funding
11. Conflicts of Interest
12. Author Contributions

### PRISMA Compliance:
- **Health Journals**: PRISMA 2020 compliance expected/required
- **IEEE Journals**: PRISMA mentioned but not always required
- Flow diagram: Almost always included
- Checklist: Often in supplementary materials

### Table Patterns:
- Study characteristics table: Very common
- Outcomes table: Common
- Risk of bias table: When applicable
- Tables are detailed and comprehensive

### Figure Patterns:
- PRISMA diagram: Standard
- Conceptual diagrams: Common
- Flowcharts: When applicable
- High resolution (300+ DPI)
- Detailed captions

### Citation Patterns:
- **Health Journals**: Vancouver style (numbered)
- **IEEE**: IEEE style (numbered, square brackets)
- In-text citations: [1], [1,2,3], [1-3]
- Reference lists: Comprehensive, properly formatted

## Writing Style Observations

### Academic Tone:
- Formal, objective language
- Third person preferred (though "we" acceptable in methods)
- Past tense for methods/results
- Present tense for general statements

### Technical Detail:
- Detailed methodology sections
- Comprehensive search strategies
- Clear eligibility criteria
- Transparent reporting

### Structure:
- Clear headings and subheadings
- Logical flow
- Comprehensive coverage of topic

## Gaps Identified in Current System Output

### Formatting Gaps:
1. No LaTeX export (IEEE requirement)
2. No Word export (most health journals)
3. Markdown only (not journal-ready)

### Content Gaps:
1. No structured abstract
2. No keywords section
3. No author information section
4. No funding/COI statements
5. No author contributions
6. No data availability statement

### Table Gaps:
1. No study characteristics table
2. No outcomes table
3. No risk of bias table
4. Limited table generation capability

### PRISMA Gaps:
1. PRISMA checklist not generated
2. Search strategy could be more detailed
3. PROSPERO registration not automated

### Quality Gaps:
1. Writing style may need refinement
2. Figure captions could be more detailed
3. Statistical reporting (if meta-analysis needed)
