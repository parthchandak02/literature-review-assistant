research_question: "What is the impact of robotic medication dispensing systems on dispensing accuracy, medication error rates, operational efficiency, and patient safety in university and college health center pharmacy settings, and what are the implementation barriers and facilitators?"
review_type: "systematic"

pico:
  population: "Pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, and patients served by university or college health center pharmacies"
  intervention: "Robotic or automated medication dispensing systems, including robotic prescription filling systems and automated dispensing cabinets (ADCs)"
  comparison: "Manual or traditional pharmacy dispensing workflows, human-operated dispensing processes, or pre-implementation baselines"
  outcome: "Dispensing accuracy, medication error rates, operational efficiency, prescription turnaround time, cost-effectiveness, staff workload and satisfaction, and patient safety outcomes"

domain: "Pharmacy automation and robotic dispensing in university and college health settings"
scope: "Focus on robotic and automated medication dispensing systems deployed in university health centers, college health pharmacies, and ambulatory outpatient pharmacy settings with a student or campus population. Includes legacy automated dispensing cabinets (e.g., Pyxis, Omnicell) and modern robotic prescription filling systems (e.g., ScriptPro, RxMedic). Covers outcomes related to dispensing accuracy, medication errors, efficiency, cost, and staff and patient experience."

inclusion_criteria:
  - "Studies evaluating robotic or automated medication dispensing systems in university, college, or campus health center pharmacies"
  - "Studies evaluating automated dispensing cabinets or robotic prescription filling in ambulatory or outpatient pharmacy settings applicable to university health populations"
  - "Studies reporting dispensing accuracy, medication error rates, turnaround time, operational efficiency, or cost outcomes"
  - "Studies reporting staff satisfaction, workload, or implementation experience with pharmacy automation"
  - "Studies reporting patient safety outcomes related to automated dispensing"
  - "Published in English and peer-reviewed"
  - "Implementation reports, quality improvement studies, or controlled trials with empirical outcome data"

exclusion_criteria:
  - "Studies exclusively focused on inpatient hospital pharmacy dispensing with no ambulatory or outpatient applicability"
  - "Studies on medication administration devices (e.g., infusion pumps, insulin pens) not involving dispensing workflow automation"
  - "Studies without empirical outcome data (e.g., opinion pieces, editorials, purely descriptive technology overviews without evaluation)"
  - "Non-peer-reviewed sources, conference-only abstracts lacking a full-length peer-reviewed paper"
  - "Studies on inventory management or procurement systems without a dispensing accuracy or patient safety outcome"
  - "Non-English publications"
