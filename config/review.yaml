research_question: "How do conversational AI tutors impact learning outcomes, engagement, and knowledge retention in health science education, and what are the key design factors and implementation challenges?"
review_type: "systematic"

pico:
  population: "Health science students and health professions learners"
  intervention: "Conversational AI tutors (including chatbots, intelligent tutoring systems, and LLM-based tutors)"
  comparison: "Traditional instruction, no intervention, human tutors, or alternative educational technologies"
  outcome: "Learning outcomes, engagement, knowledge retention, clinical reasoning, and skill development"

domain: "AI-powered educational technology in health sciences"
scope: "Focus on conversational AI tutors used in health science education. Includes both legacy chatbot and intelligent tutoring system (ITS) implementations and modern LLM-powered tutors (post-2022, e.g., GPT-4-based, Claude-based systems). Covers medical, nursing, pharmacy, dental, and allied health programs."

inclusion_criteria:
  - "Studies on conversational AI tutors or chatbots for health science education"
  - "Studies evaluating LLM-based (e.g., GPT, Claude, Gemini) educational chatbots or conversational agents"
  - "Implementation in medical, nursing, pharmacy, dental, or allied health programs"
  - "Learning outcomes, knowledge retention, clinical reasoning, or skill development measures"
  - "Student engagement, satisfaction, or user experience evaluations"
  - "Published in English and peer-reviewed"

exclusion_criteria:
  - "Non-conversational educational technology (e.g., passive video, static e-learning modules)"
  - "Non-health science domains (unless providing direct comparative context for health science findings)"
  - "Studies without empirical evaluation or outcomes data"
  - "Opinion pieces, editorials, or non-peer-reviewed sources"
  - "Conference-only abstracts lacking a full-length paper (i.e., abstracts submitted to conferences without an associated peer-reviewed full paper)"
